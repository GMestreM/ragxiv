# ragXiv: Retrieval-Augmented Genearation with arXiv knowledge base

Retrieval-Augmented Genearation (RAG) system that leverages the vast repository of academic papers on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) as its  primary knowledge base.

## Overview

**ragXiv** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to facilitate i**nformation extraction and expert-level communication on academic quantitative finance topics**. Leveraging the vast repository of academic papers on arXiv, ragXiv aims to streamline the process of retrieving and synthesizing relevant information from scholarly literature, **making complex quantitative finance topics more accessible**.

### Problem Statement

The exponential growth of academic literature poses a significant challenge for researchers and professionals in staying up-to-date with the latest developments. Particularly in the field of quantitative finance, where the depth and complexity of the subject matter can be overwhelming, finding and extracting relevant information from numerous academic papers is time-consuming and cumbersome.

Traditional search engines and databases provide basic keyword-based search functionalities but often fall short in delivering precise and contextually relevant information. Furthermore, the sheer volume of papers makes manual extraction and comprehension of the material inefficient, especially when users require concise explanations of intricate topics.

ragXiv addresses these challenges by implementing a sophisticated **two-step semantic search and retrieval system** that draws upon the extensive arXiv database for quantitative finance. By combining advanced natural language processing techniques with vector-based search capabilities, ragXiv effectively narrows down the vast pool of academic papers to those most pertinent to the user's query and delivers expert-level explanations derived from these sources.

### Key features

1. **Semantic Search in Two Steps**:

    - **Abstract-Level Search**: The system first performs a semantic search between the userâ€™s query and the abstracts of academic papers. This step narrows down the relevant documents, focusing on the most contextually aligned abstracts.
    - **Body-Level Search**: After identifying the most relevant abstracts, ragXiv conducts a second semantic search, this time between the user's query and the body content of the selected papers. This ensures that the most pertinent sections of the papers are considered.

2. **Contextual Information Extraction**:

    - Once the relevant abstracts and paper sections are identified, ragXiv builds a context that includes these elements, ensuring the system's responses are based on accurate and contextually relevant information.

3. **Expert-Level Summarization**:

    - The extracted information is used to prompt a Language Model (LLM) to generate clear, concise, and expert-level answers to user queries. The LLM is instructed to rely solely on the provided context, ensuring responses are grounded in the academic literature.

4. **Database-Backed Retrieval**:

    - ragXiv uses a Postgres database with `pg_vector` to store and retrieve vector embeddings of abstracts and paper sections, enabling efficient and scalable search operations.

### Impact

ragXiv empowers researchers, students, and professionals in the field of quantitative finance by providing a tool that not only retrieves relevant academic papers but also distills complex information into understandable explanations. This system reduces the time and effort needed to sift through large volumes of literature, enabling users to focus on advancing their research or understanding of the field.

### Future Directions

While this proof-of-concept version of ragXiv is limited to HTML-formatted papers, future iterations will aim to extend support to PDF documents, incorporate broader academic fields, and enhance the LLM's ability to communicate even more nuanced and complex topics.
